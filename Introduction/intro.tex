\section{Introduction}
The presented work deals with two major topics: web customization platforms and
activity sculptures. For the former topic interaction processes and usability aspects
applied in current projects are of great interest as they provide a foundation on
which the author's prototype will be built upon. The latter will help the user
explore and engage with their activity data in a meaningful way, first in virtual and later in
physical 3D space. The following sections describe an in depth look at the
motivation of this work, the problems that are set to be resolved and the goals
to be achieved. To conclude this chapter a general overview of each chapter will be
provided. 

\subsection{Motivation}
boom of Customization of products 
Importance of web configurators in e commerce applications
Web technologies allow new interaction methods
Advent of the Quantified self
Activity Sculptures 
3D fabrication
Wrapping it up


\subsection{Goals}
\subsection{Content overview}
The presented work takes the following structure. Chapter 2 presents current
configurators in different fields of the industry and academic research. Further
on current projects related to activity sculptures will be discussed. The final
section of the chapter presents an analysis of activity data sources
and current implementation of available fitness tracker APIs. In Chapter 3 the
prototype design process will be presented. For this sketches and concepts for
both sculptures and the configurator will be explained concluding with final
thoughts about the final decision making. Chapter 4 deals with the development
and implementation of the prototype. In this chapter the prototype's architecture and
special features will be discussed. Chapter 5 is focused on the design and
execution of the user study concluding with a discussion about the results and
findings of the study. Chapter 6 concludes this work and chapter 7 states the
ways on which this work can be further developed.
