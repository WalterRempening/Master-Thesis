\section{Introduction}
The presented work deals with two major topics: web customization platforms and
activity sculptures. For the former topic interaction processes and usability aspects
applied in current projects are of great interest as they provide a foundation on
which the author's prototype will be built upon. The latter will help the user
explore and engage with their activity data first in virtual and later in
physical 3D space. The following sections describe an in depth look at the
motivation of this work, the problems that are set to be resolved and the goals
to be achieved. To conclude this chapter a general overview of each chapter will be
provided.
